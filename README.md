> A dead simple static site generator and web development boilerplate

## What is Mimogear?

**Mimogear is a simple static site generator and web development boilerplate** that will _automatically compile, distribute, watch, and deploy development assets_.

## Why Mimogear?

After looking through all the cool static site generators out there, you may have realized that they are fairly complex. Mimogear aims to be the simplest static site generator out there while balancing a useful set of features.

## Highlights

* Full asset compilation, distribution, and watch using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) starter kit for deployments to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) 
* Documentation for [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) deployments and hosting
* Complete [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template boilerplate, with Markdown support, for generating html files
* Clean skeleton [postcss](http://postcss.org/) boilerplate for quick css development
* Starter javascript components

## Installation

Before we start setting up Mimogear, make sure you've cloned Mimogear from github:

* [download mimogear.zip](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/archive/master.zip)
* use https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear.git to clone with a git program
* type `git clone https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear.git` in your terminal

After successfully cloning Mimogear, we'll need to download _node.js_ from [node's website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to help with managing Mimogear's dependencies.

Now that we have all the goodies ready for us, open up your terminal and enter in the following:

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear> (drag the folder into your terminal)
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install
gulp
```

Your site will open up in a browser window automatically and you're ready to get started in developing html:pug, css:postcss, and javascript. Check out /src/ to see your shiny new development boilerplate!

## Thank You, Everyone!

I hope you enjoy developing with Mimogear as much as I have enjoyed building it! Please share it if you love it! This static site generator wouldn't be possible without all the help of my friends. They've contributed to every single aspect of this without knowing it ^w^ Most notably [Nick Hall](https://github.com/nhall) for being the best mentor in the world!
