## Getting Started

Mimogear uses [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) so make sure to get that before you start! Once you're ready, whip out your terminal and enter in the following goodies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear.git
cd mimogear
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install
gulp
```

Your site will open up in a browser window automatically, gulp will begin watching your files, and browserSync will automatically reload your changes. Now you're ready to get started in developing html:pug, css:sass, and javascript. Check out /src/ to see your shiny new web development boilerplate!
