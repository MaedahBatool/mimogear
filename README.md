> A dead simple static site generator and web development boilerplate

## What is Mimogear?

**Mimogear is a simple static site generator and web development boilerplate** that will _automatically compile, distribute, watch, and deploy development assets_.

## Why Mimogear?

After looking through all the cool static site generators out there, you may have realized that they are fairly complex. Mimogear aims to be the simplest static site generator out there while balancing a useful set of features.

## Highlights

* Full asset compilation, distribution, watch, and deployment
* Complete pug boilerplate for generating html files
* Clean skeleton postcss boilerplate for quick css development
* Thoroughly tested javascript components

## Installation

Mimogear uses _node package manager_ in order to download all of the necessary build dependencies. If you haven't downloaded node before, head over to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download the latest version of node. Once you've installed node and have downloaded Mimogear, let's `cd` into the project directory and then download our dependencies using a terminal:

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear> (drag the folder into your terminal)
npm install
npm install gulp-cli -g
gulp
```

After that your project will open up in a browser window automatically and you're ready to get started in developing html:pug, css:postcss, and javascript. Head over to /src/ to see your shiny new development boilerplate! If you're feeling stuck, check out [/docs/](https://github.com/mimoduo/mimogear/tree/master/docs).

## Thank You, Everyone!

I hope you enjoy developing with Mimogear as much as I have enjoyed building it! Please share it if you love it! This static site generator wouldn't be possible without all the help of my friends. They've contributed to every single aspect of this without knowing it ^w^ Most notably [Nick Hall](https://github.com/nhall) for being the best mentor in the world!
