# Mimogear

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mimoduo/mimogear.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mimoduo/mimogear)

> **Mimogear is a simple static site generator and web development boilerplate** that will _automatically compile, distribute, watch, and deploy assets_.

## Highlights

* Full asset compilation, distribution, and watch using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) starter kit for deployments to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)
* Documentation for [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) deployments and hosting
* Complete [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template boilerplate, with Markdown support, for generating html files
* Clean skeleton [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) boilerplate for quick css development
* Starter javascript components

## Getting Started

Mimogear uses [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) so make sure to get that before you start! Once you're ready, whip out your terminal and enter in the following goodies:

```sh
cd <folder-of-Mimogear> (drag the folder into your terminal)
npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install
gulp
```

Your site will open up in a browser window automatically and you're ready to get started in developing html:pug, css:sass, and javascript. Check out /src/ to see your shiny new development boilerplate!
