# Github Pages

Mimogear uses gulp-gh-pages to help push to the gh-pages branch of your github repository. You won't have to set this step up but for it to be really useful you'll want to setup travis-ci. By integrating with travis-ci, you'll be able to deploy to this branch whenever you commit to master.
